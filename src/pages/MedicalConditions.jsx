  "Acne": {
    name: "Acne",
    description: "Acne is a common medical skin condition affecting up to 90% of adolescents and sometimes adults. It causes pimples, blackheads, and cysts, mainly on the face, chest, and back. Though often seen as cosmetic, it requires treatment to prevent scarring and emotional distress.",
    causes: "Acne develops when pores clog with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria, causing inflammation. Whiteheads occur when pores are fully blocked, while blackheads form when clogged pores remain open and darken on exposure to air. Excess oil and inflammation can lead to deeper cysts and nodules. Causes include hormonal, genetic, and environmental factors. Androgens, which rise during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy, increase oil production. Family history, comedogenic products, certain medications, diet, and stress can also trigger acne.",

  "Atopic Dermatitis": {
    name: "Atopic Dermatitis",
    description: "Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic, itchy, and flaky skin condition often affecting the face, arms, and legs. It results from a gene variation that weakens the skin’s barrier, causing dryness and sensitivity. Flares occur due to allergens, irritants, or environmental factors and are more common in people with asthma or allergies. Common in children, eczema often appears before age five; about 60% outgrow it by adulthood, though some continue to have chronic, relapsing symptoms.",
    treatment: "Though there is no cure for eczema, there are treatments that can relieve its symptoms.",
    causes: "Atopic dermatitis is caused by a combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors that weaken the skin barrier, making it dry and prone to irritation. It often runs in families and can be triggered by allergens, stress, heat, or harsh soaps.",

A variant called palmo-plantar psoriasis affects the palms and soles, sometimes leading to severe nail damage and may be triggered by certain treatments for psoriasis or Crohn’s disease.",
    causes: "Psoriasis is caused by an overactive immune system that speeds up skin cell growth. It often runs in families and can be triggered by stress, infections, cold weather, skin injury, certain medications, smoking, or alcohol.",

  },
  "Boils":{
    name: "Boils",
    description: "boil (furuncle) is a painful, pus-filled bump that starts as a red lump and grows as it fills with pus. It commonly appears on hair-bearing, sweaty, or friction-prone areas like the neck, armpits, thighs, and buttocks. When multiple boils merge, they form a larger infection called a carbuncle. Diagnosis is usually made by visual examination.",
    treatment: "Treatment may involve a minor procedure to remove trapped pus, and in more serious or recurring cases, medication may be prescribed to control the infection.",
    causes: "Boils originate due to the rapid buildup of pus caused by a bacterial infection in hair follicles under the skin. As excessive amounts of pus fill the small bumps, the growth becomes larger and more painful, eventually leading to its own rupture and drainage.",

  },
  "Cellulitis":{
    name: "Cellulitis",
